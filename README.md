# SNHU Cross-Course Portfolio
### Author: Kyle Keiper

In short, this repository is a collection of work from various SNHU courses that I need to put together for the final program project. You will find a collection of various documents and programs that I have compiled in this repository.

## CS 255 System Analysis and Design
* **Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
What did you do particularly well?**

    The DriverPass project was a software project designed to help Liam create a business that trains students to pass drivers' exams. They needed a web application that allowed for multi-user management, client billing, and fetching of remote data. I think I did a good job of capturing the class diagram of the project.
* **If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

    I would improve the use-case diagram. I did this wrong the first time and I would revise it to make it more like what it's supposed to be.
* **How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

    I listened and used my experience to create what they wanted, even if they said it wrong or forgot features that are needed. The user is paying the developer; if the project doesn't come out as a useful tool for the user, they won't hire your company again. The client is always "right", even when they aren't.
* **How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?**

    I like to start by imagining the system, then create UML class diagrams. I feel like knowing what parts have which responsibilities helps us know how the system interacts and where it can be improved.

## CS 250 [Sprint Review and Retrospective](https://github.com/kkeiper1103/snhu-portfolio/blob/main/Journal%20-%20Scrum%20Master.docx)
* **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
 "User stories" are a great way to gather boiled down reasons for a feature. It helps aim the direction of a project by giving a "_who_ needs _what_ because _why_". 
* **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  I already incorporated a lot of agile processes in my development. I regularly communicate with the client to see if the direction I'm trending toward is the direction they're envisioning. I like the idea of small increments that are regularly tested and reviewed, so I'm definitely adopting this practice.
* **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  In software development, a good team member means doing what I can, when I can, and staying out of things that aren't mine to handle. Agile emphasizes that all developers share the _same_ title, so not having a chip on my shoulder for the type of development I do, whatever that is, is very important. No one member is more important than another, so remembering that might be the best thing I can do.
