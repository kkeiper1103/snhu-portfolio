# SNHU Cross-Course Portfolio
### Author: Kyle Keiper

In short, this repository is a collection of work from various SNHU courses that I need to put together for the final program project. You will find a collection of various documents and programs that I have compiled in this repository.

## CS 250 [Sprint Review and Retrospective](https://github.com/kkeiper1103/snhu-portfolio/blob/main/Journal%20-%20Scrum%20Master.docx)
* **How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**
 "User stories" are a great way to gather boiled down reasons for a feature. It helps aim the direction of a project by giving a "_who_ needs _what_ because _why_". 
* **How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**
  I already incorporated a lot of agile processes in my development. I regularly communicate with the client to see if the direction I'm trending toward is the direction they're envisioning. I like the idea of small increments that are regularly tested and reviewed, so I'm definitely adopting this practice.
* **What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**
  In software development, a good team member means doing what I can, when I can, and staying out of things that aren't mine to handle. Agile emphasizes that all developers share the _same_ title, so not having a chip on my shoulder for the type of development I do, whatever that is, is very important. No one member is more important than another, so remembering that might be the best thing I can do.
